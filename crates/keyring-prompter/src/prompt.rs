//! The UI-facing contract for the prompter.
//!
//! The gcr/D-Bus machinery in this crate knows nothing about how a prompt is
//! actually shown — it hands a [`PromptRequest`] to a [`Prompter`] and gets a
//! [`PromptResponse`] back. The binary supplies the implementation (in our
//! case, by spawning the `psst` dialog), so this crate stays free of any UI
//! or pinentry dependency.
